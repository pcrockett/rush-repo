## Phil's Rush Packages

My personal [Rush](https://github.com/DannyBen/rush-cli) package repository.

If you...

* don't want to install Rush
* DO want some of these packages
* DO like living dangerously

... then you can use [my YOLO script](https://philcrockett.com/yolo/v1.sh):

```bash
curl -SsfL https://philcrockett.com/yolo/v1.sh \
    | bash -s -- <PACKAGE_NAMES...>
```
