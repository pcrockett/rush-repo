# Nushell from Debian / Ubuntu Repos

Nushell has a .deb repo at Gemfury. This Rush package configures `apt` on your machine
to use that repo, then installs it. From then on, updates should happen as usual via
`apt`.

Based on instructions from
[install documentation](https://www.nushell.sh/book/installation.html).
